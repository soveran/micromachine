MicroMachine
============

Minimal Finite State Machine.

Description
-----------

There are many finite state machine implementations for Ruby, and they
all provide a nice DSL for declaring events, exceptions, callbacks,
and all kinds of niceties in general.

But if all you want is a finite state machine, look no further: this
has less than 50 lines of code and provides everything a finite state
machine must have, and nothing more.

Usage
-----

``` ruby
require 'micromachine'

machine = MicroMachine.new(:new) # Initial state.

# Define the possible transitions for each event.
machine.when(:confirm, new: :confirmed)
machine.when(:ignore, new: :ignored)
machine.when(:reset, confirmed: :new, ignored: :new)

machine.trigger(:confirm)  #=> true
machine.state              #=> :confirmed

machine.trigger(:ignore)   #=> false
machine.state              #=> :confirmed

machine.trigger(:reset)    #=> true
machine.state              #=> :new

machine.trigger(:ignore)   #=> true
machine.state              #=> :ignored
```

The `when` helper is syntactic sugar for assigning events and transitions
to the `transitions_for` hash. This code is equivalent:

``` ruby
machine.transitions_for[:confirm] = { new: :confirmed }
machine.transitions_for[:ignore]  = { new: :ignored }
machine.transitions_for[:reset]   = { confirmed: :new, ignored: new }
```

You can also ask if an event will trigger a change in state:

``` ruby
machine.state              #=> :ignored

machine.trigger?(:ignore)  #=> false
machine.trigger?(:reset)   #=> true

# And the state is preserved, because you were only asking.
machine.state              #=> :ignored
```

It can also have callbacks when entering some state:

``` ruby
machine.on(:confirmed) do
  puts "Confirmed"
end
```

Or callbacks on any transition:

``` ruby
machine.on(:any) do
  puts "Transitioned..."
end
```

Note that `:any` is a special key. Using it as a state when declaring
transitions will give you unexpected results.

Adding MicroMachine to your models
----------------------------------

The most popular pattern among Ruby libraries that tackle this problem
is to extend the model and transform it into a finite state machine.
Instead of working as a mixin, MicroMachine's implementation is by
composition: you instantiate a finite state machine (or many!) inside
your model and you are in charge of querying and persisting the state.
Here's an example of how to use it with an Ohm model:

``` ruby
class Event < Ohm::Model
  def confirm
    confirmation.trigger(:confirm)
  end

  def cancel
    confirmation.trigger(:cancel)
  end

  def reset
    confirmation.trigger(:reset)
  end

  def confirmation
    @confirmation ||= begin
      fsm = MicroMachine.new(confirmation_state || "pending")

      fsm.when(:confirm, pending: :confirmed)
      fsm.when(:cancel, confirmed: :cancelled)
      fsm.when(:reset, confirmed: :pending, cancelled: :pending)

      fsm
    end
  end

  def save
    self.confirmation_state = confirmation.state.to_s
    super
  end
end
```

This example asumes you have a `:confirmation_state` attribute in your
model. This may looks like a very verbose implementation, but you gain a
lot in flexibility.

An alternative approach, using callbacks:

``` ruby
class Event < Ohm::Model
  def confirm
    confirmation.trigger(:confirm)
  end

  def cancel
    confirmation.trigger(:cancel)
  end

  def reset!
    confirmation.trigger(:reset)
  end

  def confirmation
    @confirmation ||= begin
      fsm = MicroMachine.new(confirmation_state || "pending")

      fsm.when(:confirm, pending: :confirmed)
      fsm.when(:cancel, confirmed: :cancelled)
      fsm.when(:reset, confirmed: :pending, cancelled: :pending)

      fsm.on(:any) { self.confirmation_state = confirmation.state.to_s }

      fsm
    end
  end
end
```

Now, on any transition the `confirmation_state` attribute in the model
will be updated.

Installation
------------
